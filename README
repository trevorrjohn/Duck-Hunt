Rules:
You have three lives to kill as many birds as possible.
Miss three birds and game over!

Controls: 
To shoot simply click the left mouse button where you are aiming.

Testing:
I tested on firefox, blackberry os 6 (not supported), chrome, iphone (works
but not well).

I could not get the audio to work and would like to add sound effects
and also add more birds and the dog. The game plays very well and is fun
to play but needs more birds so that the game can be more addicting.
